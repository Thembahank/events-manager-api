# Events Manager backendWelcome to the events manager API. You can use this API to access our event & creator API endpoints.The API is organized around REST. All request and response bodies, including errors, encoded in JSON.## Getting Started### Install dependencies and setup your environmentSetup your virtual environment & then use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)```bashpip install -r requirements.txt```### Setup your databaseThe app depends on postgres.Create a new .env file at the root of your project to store the following variables:```DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/eventsTEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/em_test```With postgres running create new database 'events'.## Running the appTo run the server, execute the following (on windows use `set` instead of `export`:```bashexport FLASK_APP=app.pyexport FLASK_ENV=developmentflask run```Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.The application is run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration. ## TestingTo run the test suite, recreate db and run the command.```dropdb em_test && createdb em_test && psql em_test < events.psqlpython test_app.py# heroku dbheroku loginheroku pg:reset DB_URL_HEREheroku psql DB_URL_HERE < ./em.psql --app=app_name```The first time you run the tests, omit the dropdb command. All tests are kept in that file and should be maintained as updates are made to app functionality. ## Deployment to heroku# login to your herokuheroku login# create new app if one doesn't yet existheroku create# create a new postgres database for your appheroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev --app=eman-udacitygit add .git commit -m "your message"git push heroku master## API Reference### Getting Started- Base URL: The API is running at XXX  The backend app is hosted at the default, `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration. ### Error HandlingErrors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:```{  "error": 404,  "message": "Resource not found",  "success": false}```The API will return three error types when requests fail:- 400: Bad Request- 404: Resource Not Found- 422: unprocessable - 405: Method not allowed- 500: Server error### Endpoints ## AuthorsThembelani Mahlangu## Acknowledgements Udacity team, and Caryn McCarthy @ Udacity for guidance on best practices for API documentation
